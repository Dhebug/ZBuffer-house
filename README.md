# ZBuffer-house
This is the source code of a software rendered scene showing a gouraud shaded and texture mapped house rotating in real time.

The code was written in C++ using the Borland C++ 3.1 (DOS) as a part of my Bachelor degree from around 1992/1993.

The scene is interactive and can be manipulated using the keyboard.

- 'q' to quit the program
- space to show the information page
- '/' to save screenshots
- '*' and '-' to enable or disable the automatic generation of screenshots
- <- and -> arrows to rotate along the Theta angle
- Up and Down arrows to rotate along the Phi angle
- 0 to 9 to change the distance
- F1 to F4 for presets
